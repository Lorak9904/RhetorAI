One second, what did you think about the ride? It was great, and apparently I've never been 
on live television before, but apparently sometimes I don't watch the news, because I'm a sutter and apparently every time, apparently Grandpa just gives me a remote after we watch the Powerball. It's the Powerball. Tell me about the ride, what did you think about the ride? Well, it was great, because apparently you're spinning around and apparently every time you get 
dizzy, that's all you do is get dizzy. Is it fun? Yeah, and I've never ever been on live television, I've never ever been on live television. Are you excited? Yeah, and apparently I already went down the super slide. When I went down the slide I was scared half to death. I just freak out. Okay, okay. Wait, I need his name. Hold on, yep, hold on, I'm just going to ask him, what's his name? Noah. Noah, what's your last name? Dick Ritter. How do you spell his last name? Ritter, R-I-T-T-E-R. Okay, and where are you guys from? Wilkes-Barre. Wilkes-Barre, alright buddy. Good stuff. Have fun. We're from three different towns. Oh, right. That is my dad's town, Tom Jersey.
